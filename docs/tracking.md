Cookie disclaimer
=================

You probably got linked here from a little pop-up that says something like
"this site uses cookies to track you."
Here's the specifics:

**We track you.** You can view the site if you disable cookies,
but voting, submitting comments, and submitting quotes won't work.
If you submit anything, we'll also use stuff like [browser fingerprinting],
[language fingerprinting], and your [IP address]
to uniquely identify you if you clear your cookies.

**We do not share the data we collect with anyone else.**
Fundies Say The Darndest Things is not part of a larger ad network or analytics platform.
FSTDT is not ad-supported, and the data we collect will never be used to sell you stuff.
We aren't even part of a large anti-spam network like Akismet.

## How we use all this tracking

* block shitposts and spam: This is the main reason why we designed it to track
  even users who don't want to be tracked. Spammers and trolls don't want to be tracked.
  * we also try to detect broken spambots, so that we can save the computationally-expensive
    language filter for the good spambots and manual spammers
* prevent people from voting on a quote twice: It should be obvious why that matters.
* handle logging in and out: Besides the obvious "if you're logged in, we know it's you,"
  we also use tracking to figure out if somebody uses sockpuppets.
* perform A/B tests: Sometimes, we'll trial different UI tweaks to figure out which one
  people like more. We don't keep any of this secret; it'll always be announced,
  in advance, on the [Shy Says] blog if we're running an experiment.
